## What Is Web scraping?
Web scraping is a technique using which the webpages from the internet are fetched and parsed
to understand and extract specific information similar to a human being. 

### Web scrapping consists of two parts:
• Web Crawling→ Accessing the webpages over the internet and pulling data from
them. <br>
• HTML Parsing→ Parsing the HTML content of the webpages obtained through web
crawling and then extracting specific information from it.
